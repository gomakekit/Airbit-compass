## Note from MakeKit

This is an attempt to create an auto-correction of the Yaw-movement on the Air:bit drone.
The compass heading is compared to a desired compass heading, then the difference is being multiplied with a proportional (PID) number and set to Yaw.

* Challenge: The compass heading block uses the accelerometer in itÂ´s equation. The accellerometer will give erradical numbers when motors are spinning. Therefore, these numbers needs to be smoothed with a low pass filter. 

The low pass filter and the compassCorrectionFactor needs to be adjusted.

## As time of writing (August 2020), the algorithm is not working
